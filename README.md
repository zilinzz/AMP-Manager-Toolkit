# AMP-Manager-Toolkit

## Project Overview
This project is focused on developing a chatbot that can interact with users, understand their queries, and respond intelligently using NLP and RAG techniques. The chatbot can handle basic conversations, provide information, and possibly integrate with external APIs and models like ChatGPT to enhance its functionality.

## Features
* Natural language processing for understanding user intent
* Basic conversation flows for FAQs and user guidance


## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/zilinzz/AMP-Manager-Toolkit.git
cd AMP-Manager-Toolkit
```

### Step 2: Set up a virtual environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system-wide packages.

```
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (MacOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Chatbot (Details TBD)

```
# Activate the virtual environment if not already active
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the chatbot (TBD)
python #chatbot.py
```

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/zilinzz/AMP-Manager-Toolkit.git
cd AMP-Manager-Toolkit
```

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
git add *.py
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

### Create a New Branch for Your Feature/Bugfix
To avoid conflicts with others' work, create a new branch for each feature or bugfix. Use descriptive branch names that represent the task at hand.

```
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

### Step 3: Make Your Changes and Commit
Make the necessary changes to the codebase on your branch. Once you’re done, stage the changes and commit them with a meaningful message:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add my feature"
```

### Step 4: Push Your Branch to the Main Repository
Push your branch to the shared repository：

```
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### Submitting Pull Requests
After rebasing, submit a **pull request** through the GitHub web interface. Wait for your peers to review your changes and merge them into the `main` branch.
